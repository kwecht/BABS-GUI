BABS-GUI
========

A GUI interface to analyze data from the Bay Area Bicycle Share (BABS).


Code:
This GUI is a work in progress. Some functionality suggested by the drop-down menus and checkboxes is not yet implemented.

Data:
The BABS data is excluded from this repository. The GUI needs the data files to work. You can download the data files here (https://s3.amazonaws.com/trackerdata/201402_babs_open_data.zip) and place the .csv files in the data/ directory.
